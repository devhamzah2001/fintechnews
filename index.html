              The cash inflow and outflow are the breath of a business, which is crucial to keeping a business alive. With a good sense of cash flow management, a business can experience smooth operations while having a good amount of cash and working capital. However, this is not the case at every time of the season. Sometimes, you are short of cash, or your customers delay payments, which increases the risks of uncertainty growing over what the next month, week, or even day might bring. It's enough to make anyone anxious, wondering how much cash you will have when you need it most. Forecasting can help address this issue while also determining your capital expenditures. But the question arises: how do you forecast effectively to gain financial freedom? This blog addresses this question and discusses strategies to forecast your cash flow effortlessly so you can unlock your organization’s bottom line.
            </p>
            <h2>
              Significance and Benefits of Cash Flow Forecasting 
            </h2>
            <p>
              Nobody likes financial surprises, especially when it comes to cash outflow. You can only pay your suppliers when you promptly collect accounts receivables (AR) from your customers. If your clients delay your payments, your cash reserves run out. The higher cash runs out of a business, the more strain on your working capital and cash flow. By forecasting your cash flow, you can determine the cash in hand you have at the end of the specific period. If you lack automation in <a href="https://cadency.global/blog/best-practices-to-improve-ar-collections/">AR collections</a>, you will need to rely on traditional methods to predict cash flow. Regardless of your chosen methods, accuracy is crucial to predict your cash flow. The following are some common benefits of cash flow forecasting.
            </p>
            <h2>
              Predicting Future Cash Flow Positions
            </h2>
            <p>
              Knowing how much cash flow you will likely end up with in the coming month is now possible with cash flow forecasting. This holds true for businesses selling on credit, as this will determine the cash you will have on hand to pay your debts to your vendors.
            </p>
            
            <h3>
              1.	Building Up Cash Reserves
            </h3>
            <p>
              Businesses often need cash for organizational growth, and if you are planning for one in the future, you can calibrate your spending. This will help you build up your cash reserves that you can strategically utilize in the future.
            </p>
            <h3>
              2.	Avoiding Cash Shortage
            </h3>
            <p>
              One of the significant advantages of cash flow forecasting is that you can address the issue of avoiding cash shortage. Accurate cash flow projections can help you align your spending with your revenue so you can determine the time when you need credit during a slow period.
            </p>
            
            <h3>
              3.	Planning Business Growth
            </h3>
            <p>
              Every business, at some time, plans for growth, but there’s always the stress of unexpected expenses and frantic searches for last-minute loans. Cash flow forecasting empowers you to confidently determine which investments are within your means and whether you require additional cash reserves for your anticipated growth. Leveraging a prudent amount of credit through the forecast, you can have a clear path toward business growth.
            </p>
            
            <h3>
              4.	Getting Returns on Cash Surplus
            </h3>
            <p>
              If you have seasonal returns or you have a cash surplus to use strategically, predicting your cash flow can help you leverage your returns. You just need to make sure that you don’t need cash to pay bills or meet your short-term obligations. Otherwise, you can make good use of your surplus by predicting your cash flow effectively.
            </p>
            
            <h3>
              5.	Preparing for Atypical Situations
            </h3>
            <p>
              Business will not be the same every time of the month or year. Customer needs and a volatile market pose challenges to keeping up with the market trend. During that time, you might need access to liquid assets so you can pay your employees while ensuring the smooth running of operations. A cash flow forecast can help you prepare a cash cushion to cope with such situations, including a recession, so you don’t get caught by surprise.
            </p>
            
            <h3>
              6.	Improving Credit Score
            </h3>
            <p>
              When you can manage your cash flow effectively and meet your credit terms promptly, you will improve your credit score. Cash flow forecasting is a major player here, so you know whether you will be able to service the debt. In addition, you can obtain loans leveraging a good credit score, which ensures that the chances of paying back on time are favorable.
            </p>
            
            <h2>
              Preparing Cash Flow Forecasting
            </h2>
            <p>
              Though it is easier to forecast using an intelligent tool, for the sake of manual forecasting, there are two steps that you ought to consider for forecasting.
            </p>
            
            <h3>
             1. Choosing the time frame
            </h3>
            <p>
              This step requires you to determine the time for your cash flow projection. It can be a short-term forecast that projects cash for a month or less, a mid-term forecast that projects up to six months into the future, or you can choose for a long-term forecast that usually takes from 6 months to 12 months period. By assessing these projections accurately, you can make decisions about your future plans and growth strategy. However, the longer the forecast term, the less accurate it is because it requires making assumptions for the period.
            </p>
            
            <h3>
              2. Choosing the Forecasting Method
            </h3>
            <p>
              Generally, there are two common cash flow forecasting methods: direct and indirect. The direct method considers a bottom-up approach to forecast your cash flow and makes assumptions based on sales projections and customer payment trends. This method is preferable for short to medium-term projections. The indirect method, on the other hand, is based on forecasted balance sheets and income statements. This method is also aligned with financial budgeting and plans, which typically are used for long-term planning.

            </h3>
